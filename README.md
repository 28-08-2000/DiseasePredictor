# DiseasePredictor

<h1>Machine Learning Project on Disease Predictions using Symptoms</h1>
<br>
<h3>Description About Disease predictor Project</h3>

1) data :- This folders contains the dataset on which the model is trained on, you can either download the data from this directory or clone from the kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset"> thread </a>.

2) save_model :- This is the folder where the models are stored to train the dataset and saved.

<h3>Working with UI</h3>

<b>Step 1:</b>
Choose the Model. As per user interest,he/she can predict the disease using different algorithms like Naive Bayes and Neural network algorithm. So, select one option from the dropdown menu which are labelled as Naive Bayes, Neural network respectively. 

<b>Step 2:</b>
Now from select your symptoms, user can select any symptoms from the dropdown menu.  

<b>Step 3:</b>
Now finally, depending on the model you selected, it would predict the disease you might have.
